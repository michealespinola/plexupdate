### This fork has been officially discontinued because it no longer resembles the original code and has different support requirements. This script has been moved to its own repository here:

https://github.com/michealespinola/syno.plexupdate

Code up until v2.3.1 will remain here for prosperity and history peeking.  All new development will take place in the new repository with proper (non-forked) issue tracking.
